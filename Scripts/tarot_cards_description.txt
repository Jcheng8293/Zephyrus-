1. The Fool 
Although you don’t know where you are going, you are being called to commit yourself and 
follow your heart, no matter the drastic leap of faith it might seem to be. The Fool 
encourages you to have an open and curious mind. Now is a time of potential and opportunity 
to be daring and carefree. This card is the embodiment of a free spirit, your inner child 
and a playful soul. You never know what the future holds, but like the Fool, you must step 
into the unknown, trusting that the Universe will catch you and escort you along the way. 
Take a chance and see what happens.

2. The Fool Reversed 
You have conceived a new project but aren’t ready to bring it to fruition choosing to keep 
this idea to yourself. You worry that you don’t have the tools, skills and resources 
to succeed. You may fear the unknown, wondering “What am I getting myself into”. 
On the other hand you might be risking and acting recklessly in an attempt to live in 
the moment. But in the process you have disregarded the consequences. 
Look at how you can bring the free spirit of the fool without harming others. 

3. The Magician 
The Magician is the master manifestor. You have the spiritual (fire), physical (earth), 
mental (air) and emotional (water) resources to manifest your desires. Now is the ideal 
time to move forward on an idea. In your quest to manifest your goals, you must establish 
a clear vision of what you will create (and why) before you act. It is not enough to be 
motivated by ego (money, status, or fame) – you need to have a soul connection 
to your goals and intentions.When you are clear about your ‘what’ and your ‘why’, the 
Magician calls on you to take inspired action. You will need focused attention and 
intense concentration to bring your goals to fruition.

4. The Magician Reversed 
The reversed Magician shows you are exploring what you wish to manifest, but you are 
not taking action yet. You are uncertain if you have everything you need and may be 
unsure about how to make it happen. If you are already acting on your goal, the reversed 
Magician can be a sign that you are struggling to see progress or success. At its worst, 
the reversed Magician signifies greed, manipulation and trickery. You may be masterful at 
manifesting, but if you are out of touch with your Higher Self, you may only do it 
for your personal gain and at the expense of others.

5. The High Priestess 
This card teaches you that the world is not always as it seems and more profound 
influences are often at play. Now is the time to be still so you can tune in to
your intuition. The answers you are seeking will come from within, from your deepest 
truth and ‘knowing’. This is a signal that you are being called to embrace the Divine 
Feminine – your connection to your intuition, compassion, empathy, and inner wisdom. 
Regardless of your gender, it is vital for you to balance and integrate your masculine 
and feminine energies. Be proud of your ability to nurture, trust, sense, and 
empathise instead of hiding it away.

6. The High Priestess Reversed 
The reversed High Priestess calls on you to be still and direct your attention inward 
to listen to your voice and wisdom. You may be swayed by other people’s opinions or 
swept up in their drama when what you really need to do is focus on what is right for you. 
It is time to get quiet and withdraw yourself from the external world to observe what 
your inner guidance is sharing with you now. Ask yourself: Do I struggle to trust my 
intuition fully? Perhaps you doubt yourself or feel silly or guilty for listening to 
your intuition, and as a result, you deny your ability to tune in and receive this potent 
information. Have faith in the Universe and allow yourself to be in flow with its energies. 
Surrender and let go.

7. The Empress 
The Empress calls on you to connect with your feminine energy. Create beauty in your life. 
Connect with your senses through taste, touch, sound, smell and sight. 
Draw on these senses to experience pleasure and deep fulfilment. 
Treat yourself to a day spa, learn massage, enjoy a fine restaurant or spend more time with
your partner. Discover different approaches to expressing yourself creatively too. 
When you are in tune with the energy of the Empress, you will naturally take on her 
mothering nature. You feel a strong urge to nurture and care for others, from a place of 
loving compassion and support. Allow yourself the time and the space to enter a different 
frame of mind and receive the grounding spirit of nature into your heart and consciousness.
When you do this, you can reach higher planes of consciousness.

8. The Empress Reversed 
Reversed, the Empress encourages you to make self-love and self-care a priority. Now is the 
time to bring your loving energy and focus to yourself, especially if you have been giving 
away your personal power by placing too much emphasis on another person’s emotional or 
material needs. Too much emphasis on another person’s emotional or material needs, thus 
neglecting your own. The reversed can also suggest that you are feeling a creative block, 
especially in ‘birthing’ a new idea or expressing yourself creatively. You may worry 
whether it will be a success or if your work is appealing to others. 
For now, don’t bother about what others think. The important thing is that you are
allowing your creative energy to flow. 

9. The Emperor 
In general represents a powerful leader who demands respect and authority. 
Status, power and recognition are essential to you, and you are most comfortable in 
a leadership role where you can command and direct others. The Emperor reflects a 
system bound by rules and regulations. You create law and order by applying principles 
or guidelines to a specific situation. Create calm out of chaos by breaking down any 
problem into its parts and then mapping out the actions you need to take to resolve it. 
Be systematic, strategic and highly organised in your approach, and stick to your plan 
until the end. You may be a teacher, coach, boss, or just a good friend who likes to 
take what you have learned and pass it on so that others can be as wise and powerful as you.

10. The Emperor Reversed 
The reversed Emperor calls on you to assess your relationship with power, control, 
authority, responsibility and discipline. Are you expressing too much or too little of 
these elements in your life right now? Are they working for you or against you? The card 
can suggest an overuse and abuse of authoritative power surrounding you. Consider the 
role that power plays in your life. Seek to find a solution where you lead from a place 
of personal power and enable others to do the same. Power can be equally and 
constructively distributed – you don’t need to take it from others, 
nor do you need to give yours away. Sometimes, the reversed Emperor asks you 
to stand up to authority. You may feel fed up with an overbearing boss or 
a hierarchical organisation and feel compelled to enter a more flexible and adaptive environment. 

11. The Hierophant 
Before you can discover your own belief systems and make your own choices, the Hierophant 
encourages you to learn the fundamental principles from a trusted source. 
Work with a teacher, mentor, or guide to teach you about spiritual values and beliefs in 
a structured way. He may be an authority or a kind and generous mentor who nurtures your 
spiritual awareness and helps you access the Divine by understanding the traditions and 
core principles. You may also undertake a period of formal study as you delve into a 
subject that has been widely explored and documented. If you have already mastered a 
particular field of study, you may be taking on the role of teacher and mentor to others. 
In this position, you honour and acknowledge your responsibility to share your knowledge 
in a structured way, one that respects the age-old traditions. 
This card is about identifying with others and a way of thinking that will prompt further learning.

12. The Hierophant Reversed 
The reversed Hierophant reminds you that you are your own teacher. 
All the wisdom you seek comes from within – not from some external source or power. 
You are being guided to follow your own path and adopt your own spiritual belief systems 
rather than blindly following others. You no longer need external approval to succeed. 
You are ready to go it alone and do it your way, even if that means going against convention. 
Give yourself permission to trust your inner guidance system as you create your own 
path forward. This card is about challenging the status quo. You see alternative ways 
of viewing the world and are ready to test the very ideas and concepts you were taught 
were the ‘truth’. Encourage yourself to examine ‘the way we do things around here’ and 
ask yourself whether it aligns with your values. You may have been running on autopilot 
so far and following the crowd, but now you see that changes need to be made. 

13. The Lovers 
The Lovers represents conscious connections and meaningful relationships, as well as 
open communication and raw honesty. At its heart, the Lovers is about choice. 
The choice about who you want to be in this lifetime, how you connect with others 
and on what level, and about what you will and won’t stand for. 
To make good choices, you need to be clear about your personal beliefs and 
values – and stay true to them. Not all decisions will be easy either. 
Which can be a sign that you are facing a moral dilemma and must consider 
all consequences before acting. Your values system is being challenged. 
Do not carry out a decision based on fear or worry or guilt or shame. 
Now, more than ever, you must choose love – love for yourself, love for 
others and love for the Universe. Choose the best version of yourself.

14. The Lovers Reversed 
Now might be a time when you’re out of sync with those around you, particularly your 
loved ones. You may find your relationships are strained and communication is challenging. 
Does it seem as if you are just not on the same page and no longer share the same values? 
If so, come back to the reason you have this person in your life. 
If you love them unconditionally, know this moment shall pass and the best 
you can do is bring love and compassion to the situation. In other cases, 
you may realise that you have simply grown apart and it’s time to move on. 
You may be reluctant to open your heart to the relationship for fear of getting hurt. 
The reversed Lovers also speaks to self-love and respect. 
To what extent do you honour and accept who you are and the value you offer in this world? 
Be mindful, too, if you look at other people and wish you were more like them. 

15. The Chariot
The Chariot is a card of willpower, determination and strength. You have discovered how 
to make decisions in alignment with your values, and now you are taking action on those 
decisions. Now isn’t the time to be passive in the hope that things will work out in your 
favour. Take focused action and stick to the course, no matter what challenges may 
come your way. If you are curious about whether you have what it takes to achieve 
your aim or complete an important project, the Chariot is a sign you will be successful 
so long as you keep your focus and remain confident in your abilities. 
Be bold in expressing your desires and laying down your boundaries; otherwise, 
you will not get your way. You need to have faith in yourself and know fundamentally 
who you are and what you stand for. 

16. The Chariot Reversed 
The reversed chariot tells you to slow down on an idea or project, you might be trying 
to push a project forward when really, you ought to back off or change direction. 
Or you might have lost your motivation and no longer feel as committed to the outcome
as you did when you started. So, if something is not moving forward as you planned, 
re-evaluate the situation and check in to see if it’s a sign that you need to change course.
Then ask yourself: Is there a deeper reason things have become more challenging? 
What lesson can I learn here? Similarly, the Chariot reversed suggests that you 
may be trying to manage every minute detail in your life – but in doing so, you feel 
even more out of control. Loosen your grip and let things run their course. 
Be open to offers of help and then be grateful for what you receive, even if it’s 
not perfectly aligned with your expectations. 
You do not always have to be in the driver’s seat!

17. Strength 
Strength card speaks to the inner strength and the human spirit's ability to overcome 
any obstacle. Strength is about knowing you can endure life’s obstacles. 
You have great stamina and persistence, balanced with underlying patience and inner 
calm at this time. You are committed to what you need to do, and you go about it in a way 
that shows your composure and maturity. You need to have the confidence to overcome any 
growing fears, challenges or doubts. You have got what it takes to see this situation 
through to its eventual end. You’re a loyal friend and a solid supporter, willing to 
step up and be present when others are in need, and you might also feel compelled to 
hold space for someone who needs your strength and support. 

18. Strength Reversed 
When the reversed Strength card appears in a Tarot reading, tune in to your current levels 
of inner strength, confidence and self-belief. Are you overflowing with self-confidence, 
or are you depleted? And how can you bring these aspects back into balance? 
Check in on your energy levels right now. You may be sluggish, particularly if you have 
been dedicating yourself to serving others or have been pushing hard to achieve a goal. 
The reversed Strength card is your invitation to take stock and restore your energy levels 
by resting and withdrawing for a temporary period. It’s vital that you take care of 
yourself so you can take care of others. 

19. The Hermit 
The Hermit shows that you are taking a break from everyday life to draw your energy and 
attention inward and find the answers you seek, deep within your soul. 
You realise that your most profound sense of truth and knowledge is within yourself and 
not in the distractions of the outside world. This card invites you to retreat into your 
private world and experience a deep sense of seclusion and introspection. 
You know that you need to take this journey alone or with a small, intimate group of 
spiritually minded people. The Hermit often appears when you are at a pivotal point in 
your life and considering a new direction. Through meditation, contemplation, 
and self-examination, you may begin to re-evaluate your personal goals and 
change your overall course.

20. The Hermit Reversed 
The reversed Hermit can go one of two ways: you are not taking enough time for personal 
reflection, or you are taking too much. If you struggle to connect with your spiritual self,
the Hermit reversed encourages you to create more space to meditate and reflect. 
It is time to go deeper into your inner being and rediscover your greater purpose on 
this earth. If you have already been spending a lot of time reflecting on your inner self, 
then the reversed Hermit may suggest that you may be taking this isolation thing too far. 
Are you becoming a literal hermit and cutting yourself off from others? Do not underestimate
the value of staying connected with others, even while you are going through your spiritual
journey. Be mindful, too, of other people’s needs. You do not want to become so absorbed in
yourself and your personal dilemmas that you shut out your family and friends.

21. The Wheel of Fortune 
The Wheel of Fortune reminds you that the wheel is always turning and life is in a state of 
constant change. If you’re going through a difficult time, rest assured that it will get 
better from here. Good luck and good fortune will make their return in time. 
This card asks you to be optimistic and have faith that the Universe will take care of 
your situation in the best way possible. Meditation and visualisation can reinforce your 
intention to bring increased abundance, good fortune and prosperity to you. 
Your life is about to turn in more positive directions if you are willing to grow and 
expand. Keep your mind open to all kinds of synchronicities and signs from the Universe. 
You may be coming to a critical turning point in your life. Opportunities you could never 
imagine are suddenly available to you, and you have the chance to make a significant change 
in your life. While it may be unexpected and unfamiliar, see this as an invitation to turn 
things around. 

22. The Wheel of Fortune Reversed 
You may experience unexpected change or negative forces could be at play, leaving you 
helpless. You have a choice: you can do nothing and hope things will get better, or you 
can act to improve your situation. See this moment as your opportunity to take control of 
your destiny and get your life back on track. The reversed Wheel of Fortune can also reflect
resistance to change, particularly if you feel it forced upon you. This card suggests that 
change has become a source of significant stress, and you may be trying to consciously or 
subconsciously stop events from running their course. Accept that change is inevitable and 
you will have a much-improved experience when you can go with the flow. On the positive side,
the reversed Wheel of Fortune might mean that you are finally breaking a negative cycle 
that has been present in your life. Perhaps you have realised how your actions have created
a repetitive situation and are now ready to break free from the cycle.

23. Justice 
The Justice card represents justice, fairness, truth and the law. You are being called to 
account for your actions and will be judged accordingly. If you have acted in alignment 
with your Higher Self and for the greater good of others, you have nothing to worry about. 
However, if you haven’t, you will be called out and made to own up to your actions. 
If you seek justice, then the Justice card is a positive sign that it will indeed be served.
The Justice card often appears when you need to make an important choice with the potential 
for long-term repercussions. Be aware of the impact your decisions will have on your 
well-being and the well-being of others. At its core, Justice is about the search for truth.
As you explore your truth, you will discover that things are not as clear-cut as you had 
thought. Be prepared to dip into the murky waters and explore what truth means to you. 

24. Justice Reversed 
The reversed Justice card can suggest that internally, you know you’ve done something that 
isn’t morally right. Others may not see it yet, so you have a choice: you can hide it 
and hope no-one finds out, or you can own up to your mistakes and take focused action to 
resolve the situation. Whichever you choose, you will need to live with the consequences 
on your conscience, so go with what feels right for you. Similarly, the card suggests that 
you are not willing to take full accountability for your actions and may try to ‘dodge 
the bullet’ and blame others for your mistakes. You are being dishonest with yourself 
and others – and your unwillingness to look beyond your own fears and ego blinds you 
to the broader lesson. The card can also indicate your inner critic is in full effect. 
You may be evaluating your every move and coming down hard on yourself when you misstep. 
If this resonates, start from a place of forgiveness and self-acceptance.

25. The Hanged Man 
The Hanged Man can sometimes reflect that you are feeling stuck or restricted in your life. 
What is holding you in this ‘stuck’ position? What is preventing you from moving forward?
The Hanged Man calls you to release the old mental models and behavioural patterns that no 
longer serve you so you can see your world from a new perspective and embrace new opportunities 
that would have otherwise been hidden from you if you didn’t hit the brakes. These ‘pauses’ can be
voluntary or involuntary. If you’re in tune with your intuition, you’ll start to have a sense for 
when it’s time to hit the brakes and put things on hold – before things get out of hand. 
But if you’re out of alignment and oblivious to those intuitive signs, the Universe will 
probably put things on hold for you, in the form of continued obstacles, ill-health, and 
breakdowns. When you sense the ‘pause’ coming, pay attention to it; otherwise the Universe 
will turn up the volume until you can’t ignore it any longer.This is your invitation to 
welcome these ‘pauses’ with open arms and surrender to the ‘what is’ – even if it is 
different from what you expected. Take time away from your routine to connect with a 
new way of thinking and seeing.

26. The Hanged Man Reversed 
Reversed, this card can show that you know you need to hit the pause button, but you are 
resisting it. Instead, you fill your days with tasks and projects, keeping busy and 
distracting yourself from the actual issue that needs your attention. Your spirit and body 
are asking you to slow down, but your mind keeps racing. Stop and rest before it’s too late.
You may already be in a position where everything has been put on hold, much to your 
frustration. The reversal of the Hanged Man can indicate a time when you’re getting blocked,
stuck or restricted because other people or other circumstances have left you on hold. 
While you feel resistant, it’s important that you surrender to ‘what is’ and let go of 
your attachment to how things should be.If your life has already been on pause for a period, 
the reversed Hanged Man may come as a positive sign that you can now move forward with a 
new perspective and a renewed sense of energy. The reversed Hanged Man can also signal that 
you are stalling a decision or action. You may think you’re waiting until you feel 100% 
ready – but guess what? You’re probably never going to be 100% ready.
