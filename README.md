Added a "Reverse" Button in CardListActivity that:

- Flips the images 180 degrees

- Click NORMAL cards will give NORMAL CardFacts

- Click REVERSE cards will give reverse CardFacts

- Flips image in CardFacts if cards are REVERSED

Properly spaced cards in CardListActivity

Big Note in TarotCard.java for some explanation of some code changes

*CalenderActivity seems to be broken even before this commit*

*IDK whats wrong with it, never thouched it*
