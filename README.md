# Zephyrus-
Android App Project

November 2 (Totally wasn't working on it till 2am):

Added "name" variable in TarotCard after realizing we didnt have it
Added "three_card_spread" activity + class (Nothing there yet apart from a test)
Added 78 buttons for "Card List" activity (was a bitch, couldn't figure out how to code it, did it the hard way)
 - Need to figure out how to correspond the card with the "card_fact_activity.xml" thing
 - The Fool card should give info about that, The Magician, etc...
 - Good luck with this one üëç

Editted "Card_Facts" to accomodate long captions + description
Added "Assets" File for the text stuff (Haven't been able to actually utilize it effectively yet)
 - tarot_description.txt and tarot_deck.txt are empty.
 - Have not actually figured out how to actually save the deck... more complicated than anticipated

(I think thats everything)
